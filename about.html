        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jentl De Vos. I'm a Graphic Design student at AP Hogeschool Antwerpen. I am 21 years old and before I started studying Graphic Design, I wanted to be a teacher. I love kids and I thought as a teacher, you could be creative as well. Turned out teaching wasn't really my passion. So I decided to follow my dreams and started studying Graphic Design. I am so glad I made that decision, because I really love being creative and learning new things.</p>
